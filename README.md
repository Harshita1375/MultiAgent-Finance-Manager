# 💰 MultiAgent Finance Manager

A smart, AI-driven personal finance assistant that helps users manage monthly savings, analyze asset purchases, and receive safe, data-backed stock market trading suggestions.

## 🚀 Features

The application consists of three intelligent agents working together:

### 1. 📊 Savings Agent

Tracks monthly income, expenses, and savings (SIP, FD, Gold).

Analyzes your financial health.

Output: projects future wealth over 5, 10, and 20 years and provides actionable saving advice (e.g., "Shift FD to SIP for better returns").

### 2. 📈 Trading Agent

Scans real-time market data to suggest safe, affordable investment opportunities.

Filters stocks based on your actual "Free Cash" (Money left after expenses and savings).

Core Logic: Prioritizes "Bluechip" stability and Defensive sectors over risky gains.

See Stock Selection Strategy for the detailed algorithm.

### 3. 🏠 Asset Analysis Agent

A calculator to evaluate big financial decisions (e.g., "Buying a House vs. Renting" or "Buying a Car").

Output: Determines if a purchase is a "Wealth Creator" or a "Liability" based on EMI, tenure, and depreciation/appreciation rates.

## 🛡️ Robustness & Safety

API Fallback: If the external stock market API (Yahoo Finance) is down or rate-limited, the system automatically switches to a Hardcoded Fallback Mode. This ensures the app never crashes and continues to provide educational value with estimated data.

Safety-First Algorithms: The trading engine is hard-coded to prioritize ETF and Bluechip safety over volatility.
