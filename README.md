The application is powered by a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in a specific aspect of financial management:

## 🚀 Features

The application operates on a **Multi-Agent Architecture**, where specialized AI agents collaborate to manage different aspects of your financial life.

### 1. 🤖 Advisory Agent (The Brain)
The central intelligence hub that synthesizes data from all other agents to create your **"Fiscal Efficiency Profile"**.
* **Financial DNA:** Analyzes 6 months of history to calculate your efficiency score (e.g., "+4.1% Potential").
* **"Can I Afford It?" Simulator:** A real-time decision engine that checks your liquid cash against potential purchases.
* **Goal Celebration:** Tracks goal progress (e.g., "Thailand Trip") and triggers confetti/alerts upon completion.

### 2. 🛡️ Expense Agent (The Guardian)
Focuses on monthly discipline and categorization (Needs vs. Wants).
* **Smart Categorization:** Automatically sorts transactions into "Fixed Needs" (Rent, EMI) and "Lifestyle Wants" (Party, Dining).
* **Limit Tracker:** Visualizes your spending against the 50/30/20 rule.
* **Spending Feedback:** Awards badges like "Star Saver" if you stay within your monthly budget.

### 3. 👛 Wallet Manager (The Velocity Tracker)
*A dedicated tool to manage daily cash flow intensity.*
* **Burn Rate Monitor:** Calculates your "Daily Spend" (e.g., ₹800/day) to keep you from running out of cash before month-end.
* **7-Day Trend:** Visualizes your immediate spending velocity to spot "heavy" spending days instantly.
* **Quick Add:** Rapid entry point for daily manual transactions.

### 4. 🐷 Saving Agent (The Wealth Builder)
A comprehensive module that handles both **Long-term Security** and **Active Investing**.

#### 📉 Wealth & Security
* **Wealth Projection:** Forecasts net worth over 5, 10, and 20 years based on current SIP/FD/Gold allocations.
* **Runway Calculator:** Calculates exactly how many months you can survive without income based on liquid assets.
* **Asset Allocation:** Suggests optimal splits between safe assets (FD/Gold) and growth assets (Mutual Funds).

#### 📈 Smart Trading Plans (Integrated Feature)
* **Real-Time Market Data:** Scans live stock market data (via Yahoo Finance) to identify "Buy" opportunities.
* **Safety-First Engine:** Suggests investments **only** if you have unallocated "Free Cash" (Money left after Needs + Savings).
* **Defensive Strategy:** Filters for stable Bluechip stocks and ETFs (e.g., Nifty 50, Gold BeES) rather than risky speculative stocks.

### 5. 🔔 Notification Agent (The Watchdog)
A proactive alert system ensuring you never miss a financial beat.
* **Instant Alerts:** Triggers real-time notifications for "Goal Achieved," "Spending Spikes," or "Investment Opportunities."
* **Mid-Month Check-ins:** Warns you if your savings rate is lagging behind schedule (e.g., "It's the 15th and you've saved <10%").

### 6. ⚙️ Dynamic Profile Engine
* **Live Recalibration:** Update your income, fixed costs (Rent/EMI), or lifestyle budget at any time via Settings.
* **Instant Context Switch:** When you update your profile, all Agents immediately recalculate their advice, forecasts, and daily limits based on the new data.

## 🛡️ Robustness & Safety

API Fallback: If the external stock market API (Yahoo Finance) is down or rate-limited, the system automatically switches to a Hardcoded Fallback Mode. This ensures the app never crashes and continues to provide educational value with estimated data.

Safety-First Algorithms: The trading engine is hard-coded to prioritize ETF and Bluechip safety over volatility.
